"""matrx-scheduler host for matrx-local.

The desktop sidecar participates in the cross-component scheduling spine
as ``surface='desktop'``. matrx-scheduler subscribes to ``sch_task`` rows
where ``surfaces[]`` contains ``'desktop'`` or ``'any'``, claims them
atomically (via the ``sch_run_unique_active_per_task`` partial unique
index in Postgres), runs them via the configured ``agent_runner``, and
reports results back to Supabase.

This mirrors aidream's wiring at
``aidream/aidream/package_integration.py::_configure_matrx_scheduler`` +
``aidream/aidream/api/app.py`` (surface='server') — the difference is
that matrx-local is a per-user desktop sidecar, so the scanner runs
against an anon Supabase client carrying the user's JWT. RLS filters
``sch_*`` rows to the signed-in user automatically.

Lifecycle (used by ``app/main.py`` Phase 8 / Phase S8):

  ``configure_scheduler_host(supabase_client)``
      Wire matrx-scheduler with the desktop host's settings. Idempotent.
  ``start_scheduler_host()``
      Spawn the background scanner asyncio task. No-op if not configured
      or if the feature flag is off.
  ``stop_scheduler_host()``
      Graceful shutdown of the scanner. Always safe to call.
  ``scheduler_status()``
      Returns the current ScannerStatus dict, or ``None`` if not running.

Activation is gated by the ``MATRX_LOCAL_SCHEDULER_ENABLED`` env var
(default: off). When disabled, every helper short-circuits with a debug
log so the rest of the engine is untouched. Flip ``MATRX_LOCAL_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=1``
in the env to opt in.

Caveats discovered while wiring (May 2026):
- matrx-scheduler 0.1.0's scanner only queries ``kind = 'agent'`` tasks
  (see ``matrx_scheduler/queries.py::find_due_tasks``). Until the kind
  filter is widened or a new tool runner lands, desktop will receive
  only agent-kind work. Cross-component tasks targeted at the desktop
  surface as kind='tool' will not be picked up by this host yet.
- ``agent_runner`` is left as ``None`` here. matrx-local doesn't run
  the full LLM agent loop in-process (matrx-ai is mounted, but the
  scheduler bridge into it isn't built yet). Calling the scanner with
  a None runner means claimed agent tasks will fail at dispatch — for
  now we set ``agent_runner=None`` and rely on the feature flag being
  off in production until a desktop-side runner adapter is wired.
