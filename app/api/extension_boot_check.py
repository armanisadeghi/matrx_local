"""Boot-time self-check for the matrx-extend ↔ matrx-local bridge surface.

Goal
----
Every engine startup (and every authenticated re-run via
``POST /extension/boot-check/run``) walks the bridge surface and answers
five orthogonal questions in one shot, in <1 second, with zero external
dependencies:

  1. Are all expected ``/extension/*`` routes registered on the FastAPI
     app? (catches accidental ``include_router`` regressions.)
  2. What's the current JWT-validation posture? (full crypto verification
     vs. degraded permissive Bearer-presence.)
  3. Is the in-memory tunnel-state singleton coherent? (sanity-checks the
     observability path the desktop UI relies on.)
  4. Was the metrics module reset cleanly so this boot starts from zero?
  5. Is the discovery file (``~/.matrx/local.json``) present and parseable
     so external clients can find the engine before authenticating?

The check is **non-fatal**: a failed check sets ``ok=False`` on the
summary and produces a loud log line, but never blocks startup. The
bridge can be partially broken (e.g. tunnel down) and the user still
needs the engine for everything else.

Public API
----------
``CheckResult``         — dataclass for one check.
``BootCheckSummary``    — dataclass for the full sweep.
``run_extension_boot_check(app)`` — async entry point.
``get_cached_summary()`` — last summary as JSON-serializable dict
                           (cheap GET endpoint).

The cache is a module-level reference. ``GET /extension/boot-check``
reads it; ``POST /extension/boot-check/run`` reruns the check and
replaces it. The cache is intentionally process-local — a desktop sidecar
has one process, and persisting the summary across restarts would defeat
the "what's the state right NOW" purpose.
