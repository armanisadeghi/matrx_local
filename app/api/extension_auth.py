"""Supabase JWT validation for the /extension/* surface.

Background
----------
The engine's existing ``AuthMiddleware`` (``app/api/auth.py``) only checks
that *some* Bearer token is present on protected requests — it does not
verify the signature. That posture is acceptable for the loopback-only
boundary the engine binds to today (``127.0.0.1`` + Tauri/extension as the
only callers): the trust boundary is "if you can reach this socket on
loopback, you're already inside the user's machine."

This module adds an OPTIONAL second layer specifically for the
``/extension/*`` routes — the surface the Chrome extension calls into.
Other engine routes (``/ws``, ``/tools/*``, etc.) keep the permissive
Bearer check; the user trusts their own desktop UI and CLI clients.

Verification posture
--------------------
The engine runs on the user's own machine. It cannot have a server-side
JWT signing secret (HS256/``SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET``) — there is no secure
place to put one and no point in trying. We support exactly two modes:

1. **JWKS / asymmetric (only crypto path).** When ``SUPABASE_URL`` is set
   AND the project issues asymmetric tokens (RS256/ES256), we fetch the
   public signing keys from
   ``<SUPABASE_URL>/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`` via ``jwt.PyJWKClient``
   (with a 1-hour key cache) and verify the signature locally. No secret
   needed on the engine. Tokens signed with HS256 are still common in
   Supabase projects — they are NOT verifiable here and will fall through
   to mode 2.
2. **Loopback presence-only (the desktop default).** When the token is
   HS256 (cannot be verified by JWKS) OR ``SUPABASE_URL`` is unset, we
   accept any non-empty Bearer. This is correct for a process that only
   listens on ``127.0.0.1``: the security boundary is the loopback
   socket, not the JWT signature.

Token presence is always required; missing-token requests are rejected
with ``401`` / WebSocket close ``1008`` regardless of configuration.

Public API
----------
``ExtensionPrincipal`` — dataclass returned by both validators.
``validate_extension_principal(request)`` — FastAPI HTTP dependency.
``validate_extension_principal_ws(websocket)`` — async helper for the
    ``/extension/ws`` and ``/extension/bridge-events`` upgrades, where
    FastAPI's ``Depends`` machinery does not apply.
