"""app/api/admin_routes.py — Engine lifecycle introspection and control.

Exposes three endpoints the parent process (Tauri Rust) uses to coordinate
with the engine without reaching across to kill its children directly:

    GET  /admin/status      Snapshot of every managed service the engine owns.
                            Returns the same data dump_diagnostics() captures,
                            without the heavy psutil walk — cheap to poll.

    POST /admin/shutdown    Signal the engine to gracefully tear down its
                            children and exit. Replies 200 immediately and
                            schedules the actual shutdown so Rust gets a
                            confirmation it can act on. The engine then
                            cascades: tunnel.stop() → proxy.stop() →
                            scraper.stop() → … → process exit.

    POST /admin/diagnose    Force-write a diagnostic snapshot to
                            ~/.matrx/diagnostics/ and return its path.
                            Useful for "the engine seems wedged but isn't
                            crashed" support tickets.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Why these endpoints exist
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The engine has always responded to SIGTERM/SIGINT correctly — uvicorn's
should_exit triggers the FastAPI lifespan teardown which stops every child.
But when Rust sends SIGTERM at the same time as it pkills cloudflared,
the engine's tunnel.stop() races against Rust's pkill and ends up logging
"tunnel failed to stop cleanly" on every exit.

POST /admin/shutdown gives Rust an explicit, in-band way to say "shut
down" and a 200 response confirms the engine accepted the signal. Rust can
then wait for the process to exit naturally (no need to pkill the engine's
children behind its back) or fall back to SIGTERM if the engine is wedged.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Trust model
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The engine binds to 127.0.0.1 only — only processes on the same machine
can reach these endpoints. They are listed in _PUBLIC_PATHS so they can be
called without a JWT (Rust has no JWT to send). Anyone with local code
execution can already SIGTERM the engine, so a localhost-only shutdown
endpoint adds no new attack surface.
