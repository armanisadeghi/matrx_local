"""Scrape persistence API routes.

Endpoints for listing, retrieving, deleting, and checking cloud-sync status
of locally stored scrape results.

Deletion is protected by a two-step process:
  1. DELETE /scrapes/{id}                       → soft delete (is_deleted=1, recoverable)
  2. DELETE /scrapes/{id}?confirmed=true         → hard delete (permanent, unrecoverable)

The UI must call step 1 first and present a second warning before calling step 2.
