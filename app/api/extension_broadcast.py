"""Supabase Broadcast plumb for engine ↔ matrx-extend cross-machine fallback.

Phase 2 (master plan section C2.d) ships SUBSTRATE ONLY — the helpers
exist so future cross-machine flows have a place to land without
rebuilding. Active routing is gated behind the
`extension_broadcast_enabled` user setting (default: ON), surfaced in
the desktop Settings UI under Remote Access. Phase 3's C-bridge
orchestrator will read the same flag.

Channel name: `matrx-local-bridge:<userId>` (per-user-scoped, analogous
to the existing matrx-extension-bridge channel used for the frontend
side).

Envelope shape (engine ↔ extension over Broadcast):

    {
      "direction": "engine->extension" | "extension->engine",
      "type": str,            # "extension.invoke" | "extension.result"
                              # | "ping" | "pong"
      "callId": str | None,
      "payload": dict,
      "timestamp": int,       # ms since epoch
    }

Public API:

    connect_broadcast(user_id)          -> None
    disconnect_broadcast(user_id)       -> None
    publish_to_extension(user_id,
                         type, payload,
                         call_id=None)  -> bool

When the feature flag is OFF, every helper returns immediately with a
debug log line — there is no Supabase client, no realtime subscription,
no network traffic. The flag is read live from settings on every call
so the user can toggle it in the desktop UI without an engine restart.

Lifecycle ownership: this module does NOT auto-connect on engine
startup. The future C-bridge orchestrator decides when to spin a
Broadcast subscription up (typically: when an extension session
registers and the user has a known Supabase identity).
