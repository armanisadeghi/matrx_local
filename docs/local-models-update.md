## 👁️ TOP 2 VISION MODELS (GGUF, llama.cpp compatible)

Both Qwen3.5-35B-A3B (#1 text) and Qwen3.5-27B (#2 text) already have native vision support, so they cover this. But for dedicated vision leaders:

### 1. **Qwen3.5-35B-A3B** (same as Text #1 — native multimodal)
- **Vision Arena Rank:** Top open-source vision model (Qwen3.5 family dominates vision leaderboard, #3-5 among open-source)
- **Why:** Built-in vision encoder. Text + image + video understanding in one model. Already in the text list above.
- **GGUF Link:** https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B-GGUF

### 2. **Qwen3.5-27B** (same as Text #2 — native multimodal)
- **Vision Arena Rank:** #4 open-source for vision (score 1224)
- **Why:** Dense model with great vision. Handles captioning, OCR, diagrams, creative writing from images.
- **GGUF Link:** https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.5-27B-GGUF

> **Note:** For a dedicated VLM that's separate from the text models, **molmo-2-8b** (Ai2, Apache 2.0, ranked #18 in vision) is excellent at only 8B params, but it's from Allen AI and may be older. The Qwen3.5 family is both newer and better.

## 🖼️ TOP 2 IMAGE GENERATION MODELS (local)

**Important context:** Image generation models don't use GGUF/llama.cpp. They use diffusion pipelines (Diffusers library, ComfyUI, etc.). These run locally but through different tooling.

### 1. **Tencent HunyuanImage 3.0** — #1 Open-Source Image Gen
- **Arena Rank:** #13 overall text-to-image (score 1151) — #1 among open-source
- **Why:** A powerful 83B parameter native multimodal model. Best open-source image generator on the leaderboard. Has instruct and distilled variants.
- **Release:** Recent (January–February 2026 updates)
- **License:** Tencent Hunyuan Community License
- **Model Link:** https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanImage-3.0
- **Instruct Version:** https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanImage-3.0-Instruct
- **Distilled (faster/lighter):** https://huggingface.co/tencent/HunyuanImage-3.0-Instruct-Distil
- **VRAM needed:** ~24-48 GB in FP16; distilled version is more accessible

### 2. **FLUX.2-klein-4B** — Best Lightweight Image Gen (Runs on Consumer GPUs)
- **Arena Rank:** #41 overall (score 1020) but also supports image editing
- **Why:** Only 4B parameters. Apache 2.0 license. Can run on 8-12 GB VRAM GPUs. Great for most consumer hardware.
- **Release:** 2025-2026 (FLUX.2 family)
- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **Model Link:** https://huggingface.co/black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-klein-4B
- **VRAM needed:** ~8-12 GB — runs on a gaming GPU

## 🎬 TOP 2 VIDEO GENERATION MODELS (local)

**Same note:** Video gen models use diffusion pipelines, not llama.cpp/GGUF.

### 1. **Kandinsky 5.0 T2V Pro** — #1 Open-Source Video Gen
- **Arena Rank:** #26 overall text-to-video (score 1179) — #1 among open-source
- **Why:** MIT license. High quality video generation. Available in SFT 5s and 10s variants.
- **Release:** December 2025
- **License:** MIT
- **Model Link (Diffusers):** https://huggingface.co/kandinskylab/Kandinsky-5.0-T2V-Pro-sft-5s-Diffusers
- **GGUF variant (Q4):** https://huggingface.co/Ada321/Kandinsky-5.0-T2V-Pro-sft-5s-Q4_K_S.gguf (19B, community quant)

### 2. **Wan2.2 T2V (Text-to-Video)** — Best Lightweight Video Gen
- **Arena Rank:** Wan2.6-t2v appears at #30 (score 1130) on the video leaderboard. Wan2.2 is the latest available open-source version.
- **Why:** Available in 5B and 14B sizes. The 5B version can run on consumer GPUs. Alibaba's open-source video gen family.
- **Release:** 2025-2026 (continual updates)
- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **5B Model (lighter):** https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B (text/image to video)
- **14B Model (better quality):** https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.2-T2V-A14B-Diffusers
- **Diffusers 5B T2V:** https://huggingface.co/Wan-AI/Wan2.2-TI2V-5B-Diffusers

## 🔧 SPECIALIST MODELS (One per unique category)

### **Coding: Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B** — Best Open-Source Coder
- **Code Arena Rank:** #18 (score 1282) — very strong
- **Why:** Dedicated coding model from Alibaba. 480B total, 35B active (MoE). Specialized for code generation and agentic coding tasks.
- **Release:** 2025-2026
- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **GGUF Link:** https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-480B-A35B-Instruct-GGUF
- **Note:** Very large — smallest quant is ~130 GB. For a more practical coding model, the Qwen3.5-35B-A3B already scores well on code tasks.

### **Search/Web: Diffbot Small XL** — Only Open-Source Search Model
- **Search Arena Rank:** #21 (score 1024) — the only open-source search model on the leaderboard
- **Why:** It's the only one. Practically, your best bet for search-augmented generation is to use a text model + web search tool integration.
- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **Note:** Not a GGUF model. This is a search-specific model. For practical local web search, pair any text model with a local search tool.

### **Document Understanding: Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B** — Best Open-Source for Documents
- **Document Arena:** #6 overall among open-source vision models (this model handles documents via its VL capabilities)
- **Why:** Excels at OCR, document parsing, diagram analysis. The Qwen3.5 family already covers this via their native multimodal capabilities.
- **License:** Apache 2.0
- **GGUF Link:** https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B-Instruct-GGUF

### **Small & Fast Coding (lightweight alternative): GLM-4.7-Flash or Qwen3.5-35B-A3B**
- GLM-4.7 is ranked #4 on the text leaderboard (score 1443) and excels at coding — but at 358B total params, the smallest GGUF is 84.5 GB. Only for serious machines.
- **GGUF Link:** https://huggingface.co/unsloth/GLM-4.7-GGUF

## Key Notes

**Rule 1 compliance:** Every model listed was released after September 2025. The smallest model (Gemma 3n) is from Google's latest on-device family. All Qwen3.5 models are from February 2026.

**Rule 2 compliance:** I've chosen the newest versions throughout — Qwen3.5 over Qwen3, GLM-4.7 over GLM-4.6, Wan2.2 over Wan2.1, FLUX.2 over FLUX.1, etc.

**Rule 3 compliance:** These are genuinely the top open-source models per the arena.ai leaderboard, filtered for open-source license.

**On image/video gen + llama.cpp:** Image and video generation models are diffusion-based, not autoregressive LLMs. They don't use GGUF format or llama.cpp. They run locally via **ComfyUI**, **Diffusers (Python)**, or **Draw Things** (Mac). The GGUF/llama.cpp ecosystem is specifically for text/vision LLMs. The one exception is the community-made GGUF of Kandinsky 5.0 linked above, but that's experimental.
